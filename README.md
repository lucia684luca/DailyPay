# DailyPay

## Description
DailyPay is a lightweight, modern web application designed to help individuals and small businesses capture, organize, and analyze daily income and expenses with speed and clarity. Built for fast data entry and immediate insight, DailyPay focuses on the essentials: recording payments, categorizing transactions, attaching quick receipts, and producing clear summaries that reveal short-term cash flow and spending patterns. The interface emphasizes minimalism and accessibility so users can add entries in seconds, review a chronological list of transactions, filter by category or date, and view a live total that updates as entries change. Data persistence is handled locally for convenience, allowing users to keep records without creating an account while the architecture makes it straightforward to add cloud sync or authentication later. DailyPay is ideal for freelancers, gig workers, market vendors, and anyone who needs a frictionless way to monitor daily pay activity. For developers, the codebase prioritizes clarity and modularity: components are compact and well-documented, styles are simple, and the project is organized to make contributions easy. Overall, DailyPay aims to be a practical personal finance tool and a welcoming open-source project for learning, extension, and real-world use. Join the community, contribute, and tailor DailyPay to your workflow. Right now.
